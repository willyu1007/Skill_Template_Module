# SSOT: Business flow graph
#
# This file defines business flows in BPMN-like structured data.
# It does NOT reference modules or endpoints - those link to this via MANIFEST.yaml.
#
# Guidelines:
# - IDs are stable, machine-friendly (snake_case or dot.separated)
# - Descriptions are short business-language sentences
# - Deprecate instead of renaming: use status: deprecated
#
# After editing, run:
#   node .ai/scripts/flowctl.js lint
#   node .ai/scripts/flowctl.js graph
#
# For examples, see:
#   .ai/skills/scaffold/flow/maintain-flow-graph/examples/
