# SSOT: Business flow graph
#
# This file defines business flows in BPMN-like structured data.
# It does NOT reference modules or endpoints - those link to this via MANIFEST.yaml.
#
# ID Naming Convention:
# - flow IDs and node IDs MUST be kebab-case (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens)
# - Examples: user-management, create-user, order-fulfillment
# - Pattern: ^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$
#
# IDs are stable machine-friendly identifiers.
# Prefer deprecating over renaming to maintain backward compatibility.
#
# After editing, run:
#   node .ai/scripts/modules/ctl-flow.mjs lint
#   node .ai/scripts/modules/ctl-flow.mjs graph
#
# For examples, see:
#   .ai/skills/module/maintain-flow-graph/examples/
