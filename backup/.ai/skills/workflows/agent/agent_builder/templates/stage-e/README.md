# Stage E assets (verification evidence + report)

Stage E produces verification artifacts from `agent-builder.js verify`.

## Files generated by `verify`

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `verification-evidence.json` | `<workdir>/stage-e/` | Structured verification data for automation |
| `verification-report.md` | `<workdir>/stage-e/` | Human-readable verification summary |

If the scaffolded workdocs directory exists (`deliverables.docs_path`), `verify` also copies both files into that directory.

## Reference assets in this folder

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `verification-evidence.schema.json` | JSON Schema describing the evidence format |
| `verification-evidence.example.json` | Example evidence payload |
| `verification-report.template.md` | Markdown template used by `verify` (simple `{{placeholders}}`, no Handlebars) |
