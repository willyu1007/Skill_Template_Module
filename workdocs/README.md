# workdocs

This directory is for **project-level** working documentation.

In this module-first template:

- Prefer module-local docs for module work:
  - `modules/<module_id>/workdocs/`
- Prefer integration-local docs for cross-module debugging:
  - `modules/integration/workdocs/`

Recommended structure:

- active/ — current project-level tasks
- archive/ — closed tasks
