# 05 Pitfalls (Do Not Repeat)

This file records high-signal mistakes, bugs, and dead ends discovered during implementation so they are not repeated later.

Rules:
- Future-facing: write entries as "do not do X because Y".
- Prefer reproducible signals: symptoms, minimal repro, and the correct fix.
- Link to relevant files/PRs/commands when available.
- Keep it short; include only non-obvious lessons.
