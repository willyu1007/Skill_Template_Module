# Project registry (template)
#
# This file is created by: `node .ai/scripts/ctl-project-state.mjs init --project <slug>`
# It is the semantic SSOT for Milestones/Features/Requirements/Tasks.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Task progress status is derived from `dev-docs/**/active/<task>/00-overview.md` (SoT).
# - Task IDs are anchored in `dev-docs/**/active/<task>/.ai-task.yaml` (SoT for identity).

  # Module-first repo note:
  # - If empty, ctl-project-state auto-discovers `**/dev-docs` roots containing `active/` or `archive/`.
  # - You may pin explicit roots after module IDs are stable.
